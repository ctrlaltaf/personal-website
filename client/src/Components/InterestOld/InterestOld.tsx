                        <h2>Computational Biology</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am a computational biology researcher with a
                            strong focus on developing innovative tools for
                            network biology. My work primarily involves creating
                            full-stack solutions that visualize complex protein
                            and regulatory interaction networks across various
                            species, making these insights more accessible to
                            biologists. In my research, I leverage my fluency in
                            Python to conduct benchmarking experiments and data
                            analysis using popular libraries such as Matplotlib,
                            NetworkX, and Pandas. Additionally, I have
                            experience in performing extensive data science
                            tasks to analyze large datasets related to species
                            interactions, using tools like RStudio. My goal is
                            to enhance the understanding of biological networks
                            and provide biologists with powerful, user-friendly
                            visualization tools to aid in their research.

                        <p>
                            I have a strong foundation in software engineering,
                            having gained experience at large tech companies
                            like Amazon, where I worked as a software engineer
                            intern. During my time there, I was involved in a
                            full-stack development project that developed a
                            web-based tool to assist business and fulfillment
                            center teams in making data-driven decisions
                            regarding supply and demand. This tool enabled easy
                            querying and visualization of item data,
                            significantly enhancing operational efficiency. In
                            addition to technical development, I actively
                            collaborated with a team of engineers to create
                            design documents, pitch innovative feature ideas,
                            and integrate feedback to refine our solutions. My
                            experience also includes managing and contributing
                            to large codebases and effectively communicating
                            with other engineers to address blockers and
                            coordinate tasks. This combination of technical and
                            collaborative skills allows me to contribute
                            effectively to any software development team.

                        <p>
                            I have extensive experience working with large-scale
                            protein-protein and regulatory interaction datasets.
                            My expertise includes curating and filtering these
                            datasets to clean and parse data effectively,
                            extracting crucial biological insights. I am
                            proficient in importing these datasets into scalable
                            databases, such as Neo4j, a native graph database,
                            to manage and query complex biological networks
                            efficiently. Leveraging my mathematical background
                            in graph theory, I apply advanced analytical
                            techniques to curate and interpret large interaction
                            networks. I am skilled in using visualization tools
                            like Cytoscape to represent these networks visually
                            and am expanding my toolkit to include web-based
                            visualization libraries such as D3.js. My work aims
                            to transform raw biological data into meaningful
                            visualizations that provide deeper insights for
                            researchers and scientists.

                            I am passionate about computer science education and
                            dedicated to making learning accessible to
                            individuals from diverse backgrounds. I have served
                            as a teaching assistant for introductory computer
                            science and computational biology courses at Lewis
                            and Clark College and Reed College. In these roles,
                            I supported lectures by answering student questions,
                            grading lab assignments, and holding office hours to
                            assist students with their coursework and projects.
                            Beyond the classroom, I have mentored students
                            working on research projects under my guidance,
                            teaching them how to collaborate effectively in a
                            research software development team. I am committed
                            to helping students achieve their career goals by
                            providing personalized mentorship and support.
                            Additionally, I have experience presenting my
                            research at computational biology conferences
                            through poster presentations, sharing my findings
                            and contributing to the broader scientific
                            community.
